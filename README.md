The directory `translation` contains the `.tex` and the relative `.pdf` file containing the english traslation of Lemma 4.4, Lemma 4.5 and Theorem 4.3 of the paper "Upperbound on the chromatic number of graphs" by A. V. Kostochka contained in the file `circle_graphs.pdf`.
In the following section we present a new result about coloring triangle-free polygon-circle graphs.

The file `coloring_tf_polygon_circle_graphs.pdf` contains a polished version of the proof of the fact that triangle-free polygon-circle graphs are 5-colorable. We remark that such bound is tight since there exist polygon-circle graphs (actually, circle graphs), which are not 4-colorable.

The directory `k-chord` contains our work related to the paper "Chi-boundedness of graphs containing no cycles with k chords". In particular, it contains the proof of the fact that for every k not equal to 1 and 4, there eexists n such that the half graph on 2n vertices contains a k-chord.

TODO:
- applications of circle graphs;
- chi-boundedness;
- relation of chi-boundedness with polynomial chi-boundedness.
